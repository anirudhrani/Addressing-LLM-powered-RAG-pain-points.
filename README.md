# Addressing the Challenges of LLM-Powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation

This is our Spring 2024 course project where we investigate how to enhance large language models by integrating external knowledge through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. In this project, we explore the common challenges faced by RAG systems, including:
- **Missing Content:** When essential information is absent from the knowledge sources.
- **Inaccurate Retrieval:** Challenges in fetching the most relevant or highest quality documents.
- **Improper Document Merging:** Difficulties in synthesizing multiple documents into a coherent context.
- **Information Extraction Issues:** Struggles to accurately extract and utilize the necessary details.
- **Formatting Inconsistencies:** Issues arising from varied formats such as tabular data or lists.
- **Specificity Problems:** Retrieval of content that is either too detailed or too superficial.
- **Partial Responses:** Incomplete responses due to limitations in retrieval or generation processes.

**Key Aspects:**
- **Enhanced LLM Outputs:** Leveraging external knowledge to improve the contextual relevance of responses.
- **Robust Retrieval Techniques:** Evaluating methods to ensure complete and accurate information gathering.
- **Practical Applications:** Focused on real-world scenarios where traditional internet-based communication may be limited or unavailable.
